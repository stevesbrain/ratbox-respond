- Client scripts for ircd-ratbox challenge -
--------------------------------------------
This directory contains a number of client scripts to help automate opering
using ircd-ratbox challenge.

- X-Chat -
----------
challenge-xchat.pl is the xchat script, written by Lee Hardy (anfl@EFNet).

There are configuration options set at the top of the script that should be 
edited before use.  

To use this script, simply place it in your home xchat2 directory, (normally 
~/.xchat2/) where it will load automatically when xchat starts, or type:
	/load /path/to/challenge-xchat.pl

The script allows you to do:
	/challenge <opername> [keyphrase]

[keyphrase] is optional and should be used if your private key has one.


- irssi -
---------
challenge-irssi.pl is the irssi script, written by James Seward
(JamesOff@efnet), based on Andreas Broeckings script (zap@efnet).

Configuration is done through irssi itself:
	/set ro_challenge_respond <path to binary>
	/set ro_challenge_keyfile <path to private key file>

To use this script, place it in ~/.irssi/scripts, and if you want it to load
automatically when irssi starts:
	ln -s ~/.irssi/scripts/challenge-irssi.pl ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/.
or to load it manually, type:
	/script load challenge-irssi.pl

The script allows you to do:
	/challenge <opername> [keyphrase]

[keyphrase] is optional and should be used if your private key has one.

- epic -
--------
challenge-epic.irc is the epic script, written by David B. Kratter
(BlackJac@efnet).

There are configuration options set at the top of the script that should be
edited before use.  

To use this script, add:
	load /path/to/challenge-epic.irc
to ~/.epicrc, where it will load automatically when epic starts, or type:
	/load /path/to/challenge-epic.irc

The script allows you to do:
	/challenge <opername>

You will be prompted for a keyphrase if the script is configured as needing
to request one.
